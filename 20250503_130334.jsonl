Here is that subset:\n\n\n### Lines\n\nEverything is line-based. Lines are separated by one carriage return or one\nnewline character or one CR followed by one LF. This is called a \"line\nseparation\".\n\n### Comments\n\nComments are written as they would have to be in markdown:\n`<!-- Like this -->`. \n\n### One Document, One Database\n\nEach document starts with a single hash followed by a space (`# `). What follows\nthereafter is the database name until a line separation is found.\n\nAn optional set of lines may be present that do not start with either a pipe or\na hash character. These lines will be collected as a multi-line string\ncomprising the database description.\n\nA database consists of zero or more tables.\n\n### Tables\n\nA table has a name, a description, column names within a header, a columns type\nline, and zero or more rows. If there are zero rows, there must still be types\nand headers lines.\n\n#### Table name\n\nEach table starts with a line starting with two hashes followed by a space (`##\n`). What follows thereafter is the table name until a line separation is found.\n\nAn optional set of lines may be present that do not start with either a pipe or\na hash character. These lines will be collected as a multi-line string\ncomprising the table description.\n\n#### Table Header\n\nThereafter, there MUST be a line starting with a pipe character (`|`). This line\nis a pipe-separated list of column names in the table. Spaces are not trimmed or\nremoved; all characters between the pipes are taken literally as the table name.\nThe line must end with a pipe character followed by a line separation.\n\n#### Table Type Line\n\nThe next line is the dash line. It specifies the types that will be in different\ncolumns. It should start with the pipe character and have just as many\npipe-separated fields as the table header. Each field MUST be one of the\nfollowing:\n\n* The character `-` as a string indicator. This indicates the column is a\n  string.\n\n* `:-` as an atom or symbol character. This indicates the column is a keyword,\n  symbol, atom, or string, in that order, if the parsing language has a concept of\n  one of these.\n\n* `-:` means the field contains a number, as parsed like JSON.\n\n* `:-:` means the field contains a boolean value of `true` or `false`.\n\nAs previously stated, each field must be separated by others via the pipe\ncharacter. The line must end with a pipe character just before the line\nseparation.\n\n#### Table cell line\n\nEach subsequent line must start with a pipe. It must contain as many\npipe-separated fields as the header and table type lines. It must end with a\npipe before the line separation. Fields in the JSON number columns or JSON\nboolean columns must conform to that spec during parsing. Empty fields are\nalways allowed by the spec, and signify a JSON-like null value. \n\n### Strings\n\nStrings must not contain non-printables, tabs, or line separation characters.\nThey support backslash escaping of any ASCII punctuation character (to be\nconformant with CommonMark), `\\a` for alarm, `\\b` for backspace, `\\f` for form\nfeed, `\\n` for line feed, `\\r` for carriage return, `\\v` for vertical tab, `\\t`\nfor tab, and `\\uXXXX` for 16-bit unicode character encoding. In particular,\ndashes, colons, and pipes MUST be escaped. A single unescaped dash (`-`) in the\ntable cell lines indicates an empty string. All characters between the pipes of\nthe cell are considered part of the string; there is no trimming, whitespace or\notherwise. From an SQL perspective, all columns (even the first one) are\nconsidered nullable, at least for the purposes of the serialization format.\n\n### Keywords\n\nKeywords are serialized just as strings are, except that they indicate a\nkeyword, atom, or symbol. This string \"means something\".\n\n### Numbers\n\nJust like JSON numbers.\n\n### Booleans\n\nJust like JSON booleans.\n\n## ABNF\n\n```abnf\n\ncr = %0d\n\nlf = %0a\n\nline-sep = [cr] lf\n\npipe = %7c\n\ndash = %2d\n\ncolon = %3a\n\nhash = %23\n\nspace = %20\n\nbackslash = %5c\n\nascii-punct = %21 - %2f\n            / %3a - %40\n            / %5b - %60\n            / %7b - %7e\n\nnonzero-digit = %31 - %39\n\nzero = %30\n\ndigit = zero / nonzero-digit\n\npoint = %2e\n\nexp = %45 ; E\n    / %65 ; e\n\ninteger = zero\n        / [dash] nonzero-digit *digit\n\nnumber = integer [point *digit] [exp integer]\n\nhex = %30 - %39 ; digits\n    / %41 - %46 ; A-F\n\nescaped = %61 ; a (alarm/bell)\n        / %62 ; b (backspace)\n        / %6e ; n (newline)\n        / %76 ; v (vertical tab)\n        / %74 ; t (tab)\n        / %75 4hex ; u (unicode escape)\n        / ascii-punct\n\nunescaped-char = %32 - %2c   ; Up to dash\n               / %2e - %39   ; Past dash, up to colon\n               / %3b - %5b   ; Past colon, up to backslash\n               / %5d - %7b   ; Past backslash, up to pipe\n               / %7d - %ff   ; Past pipe\n\nstring-char = backslash escaped\n            / unescaped-char\n\nnonempty-string = 1*string-char\n\nempty-string = dash\n\nstring = nonempty-string\n       / empty-string\n\nboolean = \"true\"\n        / \"false\"\n\nnon-eol = %00 - %09 ; Up to line feed\n        / %0b - %0c ; Past line feed, up to carriage return\n        / %0e - %ff ; Past carriage return\n\ndescription-start = %00 - %09 ; Up to line feed\n                  / %0b - %0c ; Past line feed, up to carriage return\n                  / %0e - %22 ; Past carriage return, up to hash\n                  / %24 - %7b ; Past hash, up to pipe\n                  / %7d - %ff ; Past pipe\n\ndescription-line = *1( description-start *non-eol ) line-sep\n\ndescription = *description-line\n\ncolumn-name = nonempty-string\n\ntable-header = pipe 1*(column-name pipe) line-sep\n\ncolumn-type-string = dash\n\ncolumn-type-keyword = colon dash\n\ncolumn-type-boolean = colon dash colon\n\ncolumn-type-number = dash colon\n\ncolumn-type = column-type-string\n            / column-type-keyword\n            / column-type-boolean\n            / column-type-number\n\ntable-typespec = pipe 1*(column-type pipe) line-sep\n\nfield-data = *1( string\n           / keyword\n           / number\n           / boolean )\n\ntable-record = pipe 1*(field-data pipe) line-sep\n\ntable-name = 1*non-eol\n\ntable-title = hash hash space table-name line-sep\n\ntable-description = description\n\ntable-data = table-header table-typespec *table-record\n\ntable = table-title table-description table-data\n\ndatabase-name = 1*non-eol\n\ndatabase-title = hash space database-name line-sep\n\ndatabase-description = description\n\ndatabase = database-title database-description *table\n```\n"},"annotations":{"audience":["assistant"]}},{"type":"text","text":"### /home/skin/Code/skin/scsd/README.md\n```markdown\n# scsd\n\nSource-control-storable database.\n\nA text-based data format that is \"just markdown\".

I would love to change this;\nsee below under the \"Contributing\" header.\n\nNRDL is available as a package in the [OCICL package\nmanager](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl).\n\nThe system name is `com.djhaskin.nrdl`, as is the package name. Using\npackage-local nicknames is recommended.\n\nThere are three functions of note: `parse-from`, `generate-to`,\n`nested-to-alist`.\n\n`parse-from` takes one argument, which is a stream, `t` or `nil`, just like\n`format`. It deserializes one NRDL value (which may be a compound value, such as\nan object) from the stream and stops parsing at the point after the object ends\nin the stream, much like `read` does. It deserializes\nobjects into hash tables, arrays into lists, `true` into `t`, `false` into\n`nil`, and `null` into `cl:null`, and straight up `read`s numbers in (as long as\nthey validate as valid JSON numbers).\n\nThe function `generate-to` serializes a compound data structure to a stream. It\nhas this signature:\n\n`(generate-to strm val &key (pretty-indent 0) json-mode)`\n\n- `strm` is a stream specifier, as above\n- `val` is a hash table, sequence, boolean, number, string, keyword, or\n  any arbitrary combination of those value types.\n- `pretty-indent` is the number of spaces that should be used for each\nindentation level in a pretty-printed document. `0` means the document will not\nbe pretty printed, but will be minified-ish.\n- `json-mode` is a convenience parameter. It requests that the document printed\n  out be a valid JSON document. This allows the NRDL library to be useful as\n  both a JSON and NRDL (de)serializer.\n\nThe function `nested-to-alist` is a convenience function. It takes an\narbitrarily nested structure of hash tables and sequences, and converts them to\na nested structure of alists and lists instead.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is a language I made up because I am writing a command line tool\nframework and I need a language for it to both read configuration from and\nuse also to write its output to standard output.\n\nNormally, YAML would be perfect for this; however, in Common Lisp, YAML means\nusing libyaml and the CFFI, which I wish to avoid.\n\nI needed a language that has nestable documents and also have the language be\npleasing to the eye, like is often done with YAML. However, I didn't want to\nspend too much time writing a document parser and printer. YAML is very\ncomplicated. I didn't need a lot of its features.\n\nSo I wrote NRDL. Nestable, because you can have nestable documents in it.\nReadable, because it's easy both to parse mechanically and is (or can be)\npleasing to the eye.\n\n## Overview\n\nNRDL is a superset of JSON.\n\nThere are specific additions to JSON that NRDL makes that are worth pointing\nout.\n\n### Whitespace as a Delimiter (but not a structure signal)\n\nTo please the eye, NRDL uses whitespace as a separator. However, it does not\nuse it as a signal of structure. The presence of whitespace is used to separate\nkeys and values, but indentation doesn't mean anything. For backwards\ncompatibility with JSON, the colon `:` and comma `,` are considered whitespace\ncharacters outside of strings. Braces and brackets are still used to delimit\narrays and objects. Objects must have an even-numbered number of values in it,\nwith every other value being keys and their complements being values. Keys can\nbe any type.\n\n### Comments\n\nComments exist. We need these. They start with a hash symbol `#` and end with\nthe end of the line.\n\n### Multi-Line Strings\n\nThere are two types of multi-line strings in NRDL.\n\n#### Verbatim\n\nThe first is a verbatim multi-line string. This string is created by first\ntaking a normal multiline string, and prefixing each line with an arbitrary\namount of whitespace and the pipe character `|`. The string ends with a line\nthat only has arbitrary whitespace followed by the caret `^`.\n\nFor example, this multi-line string:\n\n```\nOnce upon a midnight dreary\nWhile I stumbled, weak and weary\n```\n\nWould become this:\n\n```\n    |Once upon a midnight dreary\n    |While I stumbled, weak and weary\n    ^\n```\n\nNote that each newline in the string needs its own pipe in order to be counted.\nSo, this string:\n\n```json\n    \"a\\nb\\nc\\n\"\n```\n\nWould need to be encoded like this, if pipe encoding were desired:\n\n```nrdl\n    |a\n    |b\n    |c\n    |\n    ^\n```\n\nThe normal JSON notation `\"a\\nb\\nc\\n\"` can still be used if desired.\n\nComments can be interleaved in between the lines. So, this:\n\n```nrdl\n    |a\n    # x\n    |b\n    # y\n    |c\n    # z\n    |\n    ^\n```\n\nIs the same as the JSON string `\"a\\nb\\nc\\n\"`.\n\nNote, you CANNOT put comments on the same line as multi-line comments. This\nstring is equivalent to the JSON string `\"a # x\\nb # y\\nc # z\\n\"`:\n\n```nrdl\n    |a # x\n    |b # y\n    |c # z\n    |\n    ^\n```\n\nThis feature is to enable nested documents within NRDL. Most editors have\nblock-select and block-edit. You can select multiple lines within a file and\ninsert `   |` in the front of all of them pretty easily these days. This means\nyou don't actually have to edit the contents of the document; you can simply\ninsert a prefix to each line. This operation is easy and easily reversible, and\nkeeps things readable. These three goals could not be achieved using\nbackslashes.\n\n#### Prose\n\nProse multi-line strings are exactly like verbatim strings, except that their\nline feed characters are replaced by a single space character.\n\nSo,\n\n```nrdl\n    >a\n    >b\n    >c\n    ^\n```\n\nIs equivalent to the following quoted string:\n\n```nrdl\n    \"a b c\"\n```\n\nThis is to enable a clean way to print long strings within a document. Editors\nhave the ability to select a block of text and auto-wrap it into a paragraph,\nand can be prefix-aware as well, so that they can make paragraphs in comments.\n\nThis same capability of editors can easily be adapted to make it easy to\nauto-wrap a long string with a `   >` prefix.\n\n### Symbols\n\nSymbols are another type of string introduced into NRDL in hopes of easing\nparsing and loading serialization into data structures without adding too much\noverhead or complexity.\n\nThey are \"program strings\", strings intended as bookkeeping help to the loading\nprogram, but not really intended to store user data.\n\nConsider the following JSON structure:\n\n```json\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Daniel Haskin\",\n        \"address\": \"<REDACTED>\",\n        \"eye_color\": \"BROWN\"\n    }\n```\n\nThe strings `\"name\"` and `\"address\"` don't actually have anything to do with the\ndata they are hauling. They are really just structure markers. In languages like\nC and Golang, they are usually elided entirely, and are simply used to ensure\nthat `\"Daniel Haskin\"` finds its way into the `Name` member of a struct. Even\nthe string `\"BROWN\"` is only one of a few possible values, and might be encoded\nas the name of an enum member in a compiled language.\n\nNRDL has its own data type for this use case. It is a symbol. This is a string\nwhich can be encoded in one of two ways. The first is using backticks,\n<code>\\`</code>\nlike this:\n\n```\n`name`\n`address`\n```\n\nBeing a string that names something, it is an error to have a symbol which is\nempty. The expression <code>``</code> is not allowed.\n\nThe other is as barewords. The rules around bare words is that they must start\nwith characters that ensure they don't get confused with numbers. You can't\nstart with a dash or a dot for example. But you can start with pretty much\nanything else:\n\n    name\n    address\n    __dunder_address__\n    <tag>\n    +constant+\n    *very-important-concept*\n    /materialized/path\n\nThese are symbols.\n\nSymbols should be deserialized using\nthe following guidelines:\n\n  - If the symbol is `true`, `false`, and `null`, these should be decoded into\n    the appropriate equivalent concept in the language, as with JSON. This is\n    for JSON backwards compatibility and to obey the principle of least\n    surprise.\n  - Otherwise, they should be decoded into a \"special string\":\n      - Compiled typed languages should attempt to resolve them into actual\n        program names, such as struct member names, enumeration values, or names\n        of constants. This category includes such languages as C, C++, Java,\n        Golang, Rust, and Zig.\n      - Languages with a concept of a keyword (a.k.a. atom) datatype should\n        decode NRDL symbols as keywords. This includes such languages as Common\n        Lisp, Clojure, Janet, Elixir, and Ruby.\n      - Languages with the concept of a symbol as a datatype but not keywords\n        should decode NRDL symbols as symbols. This includes members of the\n        Scheme family of Lisps.\n      - Otherwise, if these concepts are unavailable or un-idiomatic, they can\n        simply be decoded into normal strings without consequence. This category\n        includes Python, Perl, PHP, etc.\n\nSymbols can be used as keys or values, but they are especially useful as object\nkeys.\n\n## Advantages\n\n  - Easy to learn for users, with familiar syntax that matches what is used\n    elsewhere.\n  - Easy enough to read that it is usable as a configuration language.\n  - Very easy to parse for implementers, requiring only single-character\n    lookahead.\n  - Documents can be nested in other documents without changing their content or\n    adding a bunch of backslashes everywhere, just like YAML.\n  - Comments work as good or _better_ than they do in YAML, since they can be\n    interleaved with multi-line strings and object in a way that is often\n    impossible in YAML.\n  - Unlike YAML, it is syntactically specified. This allows editors to help with\n    formatting and navigation. This is especially helpful when documents become\n    large. It also solves odd corner cases where YAML comment's can't appear in\n    specific places in the file without confusing the parser.\n  - Symbols as a data type is introduced, allowing for easier parsing in typed\n    languages and keyword/symbol representation in Lisps and others.\n\n## Caveats\n\n  - Many of the same disadvantages carry over from JSON:\n    - If a NRDL document is deserialized, it cannot be serialized again and still\n      have it be the same byte-for-byte as it was before. This is because order\n      of the keys is lost in the parsing process, as are comments.\n    - Care must be taken when desigining APIs because order is not guaranteed in\n      objects.\n    - Infinity and NaN are not defined.\n  - Prose doesn't compress multiple whitespace characters at the end of the line\n    into one character, as YAML does. This is to ease parsing and keep the\n    language simple.\n  - The literals <code>\\`true\\`</code> and `true` are equivalent, and should be\n    treated the same as each other. The same goes for <code>\\`false\\`</code> and\n    `false`, and <code>\\`null\\`</code> and `null`. This is, again, in service of\n    ensuring that implementing a parser is simple.\n  - Adding a caret (`^`) at the end of multi-line strings is important in order\n    to ensure that NRDL is an [_LL(1)_\n    language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser), ensuring implementation\n    simplicity. It can also be mildly annoying though.\n## Acknowledgements and Comparisons\n\nThis format was the result of a lot of research into how other serialization\nlanguages solved the same problems which I wished to solve with NRDL. These\nearlier languages had serious advantages and represented rock-solid design\ndecisions. They also have shortcomings, which is why NRDL was written.\n\n### JSON\n\nFrom hindsight, JSON seems obvious -- or horrifying -- depending on who is\nasked. Having delved the depths of serialization, and beholding its horrors, I\nam in awe of the [JSON standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259).\nIt strikes all the right compromises, particularly when it comes to number\nserialization. Its syntax is super familiar too. To a first approximation, all\ndevelopers know what a curly brace and a square bracket means.\n\nIts only shortcoming is that it is too simple to be used as a configuration file\nlanguage. It has no comments and no verbatim multi-line strings. These are the\n\"killer features\" of YAML, and why YAML has taken over the configuration file\nspace to date, despite its quirks.\n\nFinally, it doesn't support keywords. Using a serialization language that\ndoesn't support them from a programming language that does causes friction,\nwhile using a serialization language that does support them from a programming\nlanguage that doesn't feels just fine.\n\nNRDL addresses these shortcomings with its verbatim multi-line strings, hash\nline comments, and support for keywords via its symbols, while largely\npreserving its simple, ubiquitous syntax.\n\n### YAML\n\nThe [YAML creators](https://yaml.org/) made something really special. Theirs was\nthe first language I used which allowed me to just indent a JSON blob and have\nthat document able to be passed as a verbatim string to other programs using its\npipe multi-line strings. Kubernetes makes heavy use of this, and I can't imagine\nsolving these kinds of ops problems without a language that made document\nembedding that easy. They also made a language that, in the wild, looks really\nnice, almost like I was reading a simple plain-text email.\n\nThe only real shortcoming of YAML is complexity. The language is too complex to\nimplement easily.  Many languages either simply import PyYAML or libyaml,\nboth of which were implemented by the designers of YAML themselves, or they\nimplement [a subset of YAML](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML). They do\nthis because it is very hard to implement the full parser.\n\nThey can get away with this because almost no one uses all of YAML's features.\nType tags are both useless and confusing. Typed languages don't need them; the\ntype of the input values are generally known ahead of time upon deserialization.\nUntyped language parsers don't need them either. They can generally deduce the\ntype based on JSON field kind.\n\nI have seen anchors and refs in the wild, but they generally just cause\nconfusion and headache. They are too complicated to reason about and don't\nreally solve the problem they were intended to solve.\n\nMany other minefields and problems exist because of YAML's complexity. The\n[Norway problem](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/),\nthe [Billion Laughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack)\nattack, [the 63 different kinds of multi-line\nstrings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21699210). Indeed, NRDL largely agrees with\n[StrictYAML's critiques of\nYAML](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/ordinary-yaml/), with the\nexception that NRDL recognizes the value of providing _some_ implicit typing, at\nleast insofar as that provided by JSON's types and literals.\n\nWhitespace as a structure marker is also a huge problem. [Tabs are\nforbidden](https://yaml.org/faq.html), but are indistinguishable from spaces.\nIndentation level works to a point, but if one key contains an embedded\nmulti-line string and the next key at the same indentation level is off the\npage, it's very difficult without additional tooling to tell which indentation\nlevel to which the next key belongs. Some have jokingly resorted to using [a\ncarpenter's\nsquare](https://salt.tips/text-editor-plugins-for-salt-states-and-yaml-jinja/)\nfor this problem. This problem crops up all the time in Kubernetes manifests,\nfor example.\n\nNRDL seeks to preserve the good parts of YAML -- verbatim and prose multi-line\nstrings, comments, implicit typing to support dynamic languages, pleasing syntax\nwith emphasis on whitespace, that \"text email\" feel -- without the bad parts. It\ndoes this by adding _just enough_ syntax to provide YAML's killer features and\nnothing else.\n\nThis approach also helps NRDL achieve simplicity in parsing. Realizing that the\nviability of a technology [depends on its\nvirality](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html), a major goal of\nNRDL is to maintain its status as [an _LL(1)_\nlanguage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser), requiring only\nsingle-character lookahead in the parser implementation. The reference\nimplementation of NRDL is a simple recursive-descent parser that uses\n[`peek-char`](https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_peek_c.htm)\nand\n[`read-char`](https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_cha.htm).\nMost languages have these or similar. This ensures that NRDL can be read without\nany buffering, but can deserialized directly. The decision of maintaining _LL(1)_\nstatus is a design decision that, at one stroke, drastically simplifies the\nworkload of parser implementers. This aims to solve the hampered implementation\nproliferation problem that we see with YAML.\n\n### EDN\n\nIf NRDL has good looks, it's because it took them in part from\n[EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn). Its treatment of commas and colons as\nwhitespace was, in particular, stolen outright. So also was the use of\nwhitespace as delimiters, but not as structure markers. I have a lot of respect\nfor Rich Hickey's ability to make code and data beautiful.\n\nHowever, EDN is very Clojure-centric. Both symbols and keywords are supported,\ngreatly complicating the syntax without providing much usefulness. People rarely\nuse the symbol feature, opting instead to serialize with keywords. Within\nkeywords, only one forward slash is allowed. This is in accordance with\nClojure's syntax, but not with other languages in the Lisp family. The `M` and\n`N` suffixes for numbers are rather JVM-specific, and pres-suppose both integer\nand floating-point types, when many languages only provide support for 64-bit\nfloats, such as JavaScript and [Janet](https://janet-lang.org). The struct tags\nthat EDN provides share many of the disadvantages within a configuration file\ncontext which YAML tags have. Finally, the syntax is very unfamiliar to most\ndevelopers' eyes. The Lisp community is comfortable with semicolons as comment\nprefixes, but this can be jarring from other perspectives. Configuration files\nare meant to be used by a wide audience.\n\nNRDL seeks to support the Lisp family in a practical way while also ensuring\nthat users of NRDL configuration files don't need to write Lisp to understand\nthe file. It provides a single symbol type, corresponding to atomic strings\ncommonly found in data within the Lisp family. It also respects the design\ntrade-off that JSON made to just specify \"numbers\" and have the target language\nfigure out what that means. In doing these things, NRDL aims to be useful within\nthe context of as many programming languages as possible, with special attention\npaid to the functional and Lisp languages.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nThanks for reading this far! If you are interested in joining the effort, I\nwould be more than happy for the help. Thanks for your consideration.\n\nHere are some things I'd like to see for NRDL some day:\n\n* A logo. I am no graphic designer. If you make a logo and it looks pretty good,\n  I would be happy to add it to the repo and the matrix channel.\n* Multiple implementations in multiple languages. I have implemented the Common\n  Lisp implementation, but I would like to see one in C, Scheme, Janet, Elixir,\n  etc. I'd be happy to add your implementation to this repository as the standard\n  if you wish to implement such a parser.\n* I don't use Emacs, but would welcome and love a contribution for a NRDL Emacs\n  plugin. The same goes for VS Code.\n\n## Supporting Resources\n\nCheck out the [vim NRDL plugin](https://github.com/djha-skin/vim-nrdl.git).\n\n## Community\n\nNRDL has its own [Matrix channel (`nrdl:matrix.org`)](https://matrix.to/#/!mEdAmGzxTrQPWAYdfx:matrix.org?via=matrix.org).\nNRDL also has an IRC channel on Libera.Chat, `#nrdl`.

I would love to change this;\nsee below under the \"Contributing\" header.\n\nNRDL is available as a package in the [OCICL package\nmanager](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl).\n\nThe system name is `com.djhaskin.nrdl`, as is the package name. Using\npackage-local nicknames is recommended.\n\nThere are three functions of note: `parse-from`, `generate-to`,\n`nested-to-alist`.\n\n`parse-from` takes one argument, which is a stream, `t` or `nil`, just like\n`format`. It deserializes one NRDL value (which may be a compound value, such as\nan object) from the stream and stops parsing at the point after the object ends\nin the stream, much like `read` does. It deserializes\nobjects into hash tables, arrays into lists, `true` into `t`, `false` into\n`nil`, and `null` into `cl:null`, and straight up `read`s numbers in (as long as\nthey validate as valid JSON numbers).\n\nThe function `generate-to` serializes a compound data structure to a stream. It\nhas this signature:\n\n`(generate-to strm val &key (pretty-indent 0) json-mode)`\n\n- `strm` is a stream specifier, as above\n- `val` is a hash table, sequence, boolean, number, string, keyword, or\n  any arbitrary combination of those value types.\n- `pretty-indent` is the number of spaces that should be used for each\nindentation level in a pretty-printed document. `0` means the document will not\nbe pretty printed, but will be minified-ish.\n- `json-mode` is a convenience parameter. It requests that the document printed\n  out be a valid JSON document. This allows the NRDL library to be useful as\n  both a JSON and NRDL (de)serializer.\n\nThe function `nested-to-alist` is a convenience function. It takes an\narbitrarily nested structure of hash tables and sequences, and converts them to\na nested structure of alists and lists instead.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is a language I made up because I am writing a command line tool\nframework and I need a language for it to both read configuration from and\nuse also to write its output to standard output.\n\nNormally, YAML would be perfect for this; however, in Common Lisp, YAML means\nusing libyaml and the CFFI, which I wish to avoid.\n\nI needed a language that has nestable documents and also have the language be\npleasing to the eye, like is often done with YAML. However, I didn't want to\nspend too much time writing a document parser and printer. YAML is very\ncomplicated. I didn't need a lot of its features.\n\nSo I wrote NRDL. Nestable, because you can have nestable documents in it.\nReadable, because it's easy both to parse mechanically and is (or can be)\npleasing to the eye.\n\n## Overview\n\nNRDL is a superset of JSON.\n\nThere are specific additions to JSON that NRDL makes that are worth pointing\nout.\n\n### Whitespace as a Delimiter (but not a structure signal)\n\nTo please the eye, NRDL uses whitespace as a separator. However, it does not\nuse it as a signal of structure. The presence of whitespace is used to separate\nkeys and values, but indentation doesn't mean anything. For backwards\ncompatibility with JSON, the colon `:` and comma `,` are considered whitespace\ncharacters outside of strings. Braces and brackets are still used to delimit\narrays and objects. Objects must have an even-numbered number of values in it,\nwith every other value being keys and their complements being values. Keys can\nbe any type.\n\n### Comments\n\nComments exist. We need these. They start with a hash symbol `#` and end with\nthe end of the line.\n\n### Multi-Line Strings\n\nThere are two types of multi-line strings in NRDL.\n\n#### Verbatim\n\nThe first is a verbatim multi-line string. This string is created by first\ntaking a normal multiline string, and prefixing each line with an arbitrary\namount of whitespace and the pipe character `|`. The string ends with a line\nthat only has arbitrary whitespace followed by the caret `^`.\n\nFor example, this multi-line string:\n\n```\nOnce upon a midnight dreary\nWhile I stumbled, weak and weary\n```\n\nWould become this:\n\n```\n    |Once upon a midnight dreary\n    |While I stumbled, weak and weary\n    ^\n```\n\nNote that each newline in the string needs its own pipe in order to be counted.\nSo, this string:\n\n```json\n    \"a\\nb\\nc\\n\"\n```\n\nWould need to be encoded like this, if pipe encoding were desired:\n\n```nrdl\n    |a\n    |b\n    |c\n    |\n    ^\n```\n\nThe normal JSON notation `\"a\\nb\\nc\\n\"` can still be used if desired.\n\nComments can be interleaved in between the lines. So, this:\n\n```nrdl\n    |a\n    # x\n    |b\n    # y\n    |c\n    # z\n    |\n    ^\n```\n\nIs the same as the JSON string `\"a\\nb\\nc\\n\"`.\n\nNote, you CANNOT put comments on the same line as multi-line comments. This\nstring is equivalent to the JSON string `\"a # x\\nb # y\\nc # z\\n\"`:\n\n```nrdl\n    |a # x\n    |b # y\n    |c # z\n    |\n    ^\n```\n\nThis feature is to enable nested documents within NRDL. Most editors have\nblock-select and block-edit. You can select multiple lines within a file and\ninsert `   |` in the front of all of them pretty easily these days. This means\nyou don't actually have to edit the contents of the document; you can simply\ninsert a prefix to each line. This operation is easy and easily reversible, and\nkeeps things readable. These three goals could not be achieved using\nbackslashes.\n\n#### Prose\n\nProse multi-line strings are exactly like verbatim strings, except that their\nline feed characters are replaced by a single space character.\n\nSo,\n\n```nrdl\n    >a\n    >b\n    >c\n    ^\n```\n\nIs equivalent to the following quoted string:\n\n```nrdl\n    \"a b c\"\n```\n\nThis is to enable a clean way to print long strings within a document. Editors\nhave the ability to select a block of text and auto-wrap it into a paragraph,\nand can be prefix-aware as well, so that they can make paragraphs in comments.\n\nThis same capability of editors can easily be adapted to make it easy to\nauto-wrap a long string with a `   >` prefix.\n\n### Symbols\n\nSymbols are another type of string introduced into NRDL in hopes of easing\nparsing and loading serialization into data structures without adding too much\noverhead or complexity.\n\nThey are \"program strings\", strings intended as bookkeeping help to the loading\nprogram, but not really intended to store user data.\n\nConsider the following JSON structure:\n\n```json\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Daniel Haskin\",\n        \"address\": \"<REDACTED>\",\n        \"eye_color\": \"BROWN\"\n    }\n```\n\nThe strings `\"name\"` and `\"address\"` don't actually have anything to do with the\ndata they are hauling. They are really just structure markers. In languages like\nC and Golang, they are usually elided entirely, and are simply used to ensure\nthat `\"Daniel Haskin\"` finds its way into the `Name` member of a struct. Even\nthe string `\"BROWN\"` is only one of a few possible values, and might be encoded\nas the name of an enum member in a compiled language.\n\nNRDL has its own data type for this use case. It is a symbol. This is a string\nwhich can be encoded in one of two ways. The first is using backticks,\n<code>\\`</code>\nlike this:\n\n```\n`name`\n`address`\n```\n\nBeing a string that names something, it is an error to have a symbol which is\nempty. The expression <code>``</code> is not allowed.\n\nThe other is as barewords. The rules around bare words is that they must start\nwith characters that ensure they don't get confused with numbers. You can't\nstart with a dash or a dot for example. But you can start with pretty much\nanything else:\n\n    name\n    address\n    __dunder_address__\n    <tag>\n    +constant+\n    *very-important-concept*\n    /materialized/path\n\nThese are symbols.\n\nSymbols should be deserialized using\nthe following guidelines:\n\n  - If the symbol is `true`, `false`, and `null`, these should be decoded into\n    the appropriate equivalent concept in the language, as with JSON. This is\n    for JSON backwards compatibility and to obey the principle of least\n    surprise.\n  - Otherwise, they should be decoded into a \"special string\":\n      - Compiled typed languages should attempt to resolve them into actual\n        program names, such as struct member names, enumeration values, or names\n        of constants. This category includes such languages as C, C++, Java,\n        Golang, Rust, and Zig.\n      - Languages with a concept of a keyword (a.k.a. atom) datatype should\n        decode NRDL symbols as keywords. This includes such languages as Common\n        Lisp, Clojure, Janet, Elixir, and Ruby.\n      - Languages with the concept of a symbol as a datatype but not keywords\n        should decode NRDL symbols as symbols. This includes members of the\n        Scheme family of Lisps.\n      - Otherwise, if these concepts are unavailable or un-idiomatic, they can\n        simply be decoded into normal strings without consequence. This category\n        includes Python, Perl, PHP, etc.\n\nSymbols can be used as keys or values, but they are especially useful as object\nkeys.\n\n## Advantages\n\n  - Easy to learn for users, with familiar syntax that matches what is used\n    elsewhere.\n  - Easy enough to read that it is usable as a configuration language.\n  - Very easy to parse for implementers, requiring only single-character\n    lookahead.\n  - Documents can be nested in other documents without changing their content or\n    adding a bunch of backslashes everywhere, just like YAML.\n  - Comments work as good or _better_ than they do in YAML, since they can be\n    interleaved with multi-line strings and object in a way that is often\n    impossible in YAML.\n  - Unlike YAML, it is syntactically specified. This allows editors to help with\n    formatting and navigation. This is especially helpful when documents become\n    large. It also solves odd corner cases where YAML comment's can't appear in\n    specific places in the file without confusing the parser.\n  - Symbols as a data type is introduced, allowing for easier parsing in typed\n    languages and keyword/symbol representation in Lisps and others.\n\n## Caveats\n\n  - Many of the same disadvantages carry over from JSON:\n    - If a NRDL document is deserialized, it cannot be serialized again and still\n      have it be the same byte-for-byte as it was before. This is because order\n      of the keys is lost in the parsing process, as are comments.\n    - Care must be taken when desigining APIs because order is not guaranteed in\n      objects.\n    - Infinity and NaN are not defined.\n  - Prose doesn't compress multiple whitespace characters at the end of the line\n    into one character, as YAML does. This is to ease parsing and keep the\n    language simple.\n  - The literals <code>\\`true\\`</code> and `true` are equivalent, and should be\n    treated the same as each other. The same goes for <code>\\`false\\`</code> and\n    `false`, and <code>\\`null\\`</code> and `null`. This is, again, in service of\n    ensuring that implementing a parser is simple.\n  - Adding a caret (`^`) at the end of multi-line strings is important in order\n    to ensure that NRDL is an [_LL(1)_\n    language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser), ensuring implementation\n    simplicity. It can also be mildly annoying though.\n## Acknowledgements and Comparisons\n\nThis format was the result of a lot of research into how other serialization\nlanguages solved the same problems which I wished to solve with NRDL. These\nearlier languages had serious advantages and represented rock-solid design\ndecisions. They also have shortcomings, which is why NRDL was written.\n\n### JSON\n\nFrom hindsight, JSON seems obvious -- or horrifying -- depending on who is\nasked. Having delved the depths of serialization, and beholding its horrors, I\nam in awe of the [JSON standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259).\nIt strikes all the right compromises, particularly when it comes to number\nserialization. Its syntax is super familiar too. To a first approximation, all\ndevelopers know what a curly brace and a square bracket means.\n\nIts only shortcoming is that it is too simple to be used as a configuration file\nlanguage. It has no comments and no verbatim multi-line strings. These are the\n\"killer features\" of YAML, and why YAML has taken over the configuration file\nspace to date, despite its quirks.\n\nFinally, it doesn't support keywords. Using a serialization language that\ndoesn't support them from a programming language that does causes friction,\nwhile using a serialization language that does support them from a programming\nlanguage that doesn't feels just fine.\n\nNRDL addresses these shortcomings with its verbatim multi-line strings, hash\nline comments, and support for keywords via its symbols, while largely\npreserving its simple, ubiquitous syntax.\n\n### YAML\n\nThe [YAML creators](https://yaml.org/) made something really special. Theirs was\nthe first language I used which allowed me to just indent a JSON blob and have\nthat document able to be passed as a verbatim string to other programs using its\npipe multi-line strings. Kubernetes makes heavy use of this, and I can't imagine\nsolving these kinds of ops problems without a language that made document\nembedding that easy. They also made a language that, in the wild, looks really\nnice, almost like I was reading a simple plain-text email.\n\nThe only real shortcoming of YAML is complexity. The language is too complex to\nimplement easily.  Many languages either simply import PyYAML or libyaml,\nboth of which were implemented by the designers of YAML themselves, or they\nimplement [a subset of YAML](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML). They do\nthis because it is very hard to implement the full parser.\n\nThey can get away with this because almost no one uses all of YAML's features.\nType tags are both useless and confusing. Typed languages don't need them; the\ntype of the input values are generally known ahead of time upon deserialization.\nUntyped language parsers don't need them either. They can generally deduce the\ntype based on JSON field kind.\n\nI have seen anchors and refs in the wild, but they generally just cause\nconfusion and headache. They are too complicated to reason about and don't\nreally solve the problem they were intended to solve.\n\nMany other minefields and problems exist because of YAML's complexity. The\n[Norway problem](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/),\nthe [Billion Laughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack)\nattack, [the 63 different kinds of multi-line\nstrings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21699210). Indeed, NRDL largely agrees with\n[StrictYAML's critiques of\nYAML](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/ordinary-yaml/), with the\nexception that NRDL recognizes the value of providing _some_ implicit typing, at\nleast insofar as that provided by JSON's types and literals.\n\nWhitespace as a structure marker is also a huge problem. [Tabs are\nforbidden](https://yaml.org/faq.html), but are indistinguishable from spaces.\nIndentation level works to a point, but if one key contains an embedded\nmulti-line string and the next key at the same indentation level is off the\npage, it's very difficult without additional tooling to tell which indentation\nlevel to which the next key belongs. Some have jokingly resorted to using [a\ncarpenter's\nsquare](https://salt.tips/text-editor-plugins-for-salt-states-and-yaml-jinja/)\nfor this problem. This problem crops up all the time in Kubernetes manifests,\nfor example.\n\nNRDL seeks to preserve the good parts of YAML -- verbatim and prose multi-line\nstrings, comments, implicit typing to support dynamic languages, pleasing syntax\nwith emphasis on whitespace, that \"text email\" feel -- without the bad parts. It\ndoes this by adding _just enough_ syntax to provide YAML's killer features and\nnothing else.\n\nThis approach also helps NRDL achieve simplicity in parsing. Realizing that the\nviability of a technology [depends on its\nvirality](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html), a major goal of\nNRDL is to maintain its status as [an _LL(1)_\nlanguage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser), requiring only\nsingle-character lookahead in the parser implementation. The reference\nimplementation of NRDL is a simple recursive-descent parser that uses\n[`peek-char`](https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_peek_c.htm)\nand\n[`read-char`](https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_cha.htm).\nMost languages have these or similar. This ensures that NRDL can be read without\nany buffering, but can deserialized directly. The decision of maintaining _LL(1)_\nstatus is a design decision that, at one stroke, drastically simplifies the\nworkload of parser implementers. This aims to solve the hampered implementation\nproliferation problem that we see with YAML.\n\n### EDN\n\nIf NRDL has good looks, it's because it took them in part from\n[EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn). Its treatment of commas and colons as\nwhitespace was, in particular, stolen outright. So also was the use of\nwhitespace as delimiters, but not as structure markers. I have a lot of respect\nfor Rich Hickey's ability to make code and data beautiful.\n\nHowever, EDN is very Clojure-centric. Both symbols and keywords are supported,\ngreatly complicating the syntax without providing much usefulness. People rarely\nuse the symbol feature, opting instead to serialize with keywords. Within\nkeywords, only one forward slash is allowed. This is in accordance with\nClojure's syntax, but not with other languages in the Lisp family. The `M` and\n`N` suffixes for numbers are rather JVM-specific, and pres-suppose both integer\nand floating-point types, when many languages only provide support for 64-bit\nfloats, such as JavaScript and [Janet](https://janet-lang.org). The struct tags\nthat EDN provides share many of the disadvantages within a configuration file\ncontext which YAML tags have. Finally, the syntax is very unfamiliar to most\ndevelopers' eyes. The Lisp community is comfortable with semicolons as comment\nprefixes, but this can be jarring from other perspectives. Configuration files\nare meant to be used by a wide audience.\n\nNRDL seeks to support the Lisp family in a practical way while also ensuring\nthat users of NRDL configuration files don't need to write Lisp to understand\nthe file. It provides a single symbol type, corresponding to atomic strings\ncommonly found in data within the Lisp family. It also respects the design\ntrade-off that JSON made to just specify \"numbers\" and have the target language\nfigure out what that means. In doing these things, NRDL aims to be useful within\nthe context of as many programming languages as possible, with special attention\npaid to the functional and Lisp languages.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nThanks for reading this far! If you are interested in joining the effort, I\nwould be more than happy for the help. Thanks for your consideration.\n\nHere are some things I'd like to see for NRDL some day:\n\n* A logo. I am no graphic designer. If you make a logo and it looks pretty good,\n  I would be happy to add it to the repo and the matrix channel.\n* Multiple implementations in multiple languages. I have implemented the Common\n  Lisp implementation, but I would like to see one in C, Scheme, Janet, Elixir,\n  etc. I'd be happy to add your implementation to this repository as the standard\n  if you wish to implement such a parser.\n* I don't use Emacs, but would welcome and love a contribution for a NRDL Emacs\n  plugin. The same goes for VS Code.\n\n## Supporting Resources\n\nCheck out the [vim NRDL plugin](https://github.com/djha-skin/vim-nrdl.git).\n\n## Community\n\nNRDL has its own [Matrix channel (`nrdl:matrix.org`)](https://matrix.to/#/!mEdAmGzxTrQPWAYdfx:matrix.org?via=matrix.org).\nNRDL also has an IRC channel on Libera.Chat, `#nrdl`. The matrix channel is\npreferred.\n\n## ABNF\n\n```\n\nNRDL-text = *( sep )\n             value\n\n; String section\n\nvalue = string\n      / symbol\n      / number\n      / array\n      / object\n\nobject = begin-object\n          *sep\n          *(value 1*sep value)\n          *(1*sep value 1*sep value)\n          *sep\n          end-object\n\nbegin-object = %x7B ws ;

It is modern in the sense that:\n* All software is [packaged as OCI-compliant artifacts](https://github.com/opencontainers/) and distributed from mirrored OCI-compliant registries (the GitHub and Docker Hub Container Registries).\n* All software packages are securely distributed over TLS connections.\n* All connections respect ``HTTPS_PROXY`` environment settings for authenticated proxy support.\n* [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) is used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of all software packages.\n* Software packages are project-local by default, simplifying the process of tying specific versions to your projects.\n* All software packages are built and published transparently using hosted CI infrastructure ([github actions](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl-action)).\n* LLM-generated summaries of changes between versions are available for all packages.\n\n``ocicl`` is pronounced like\n\"[ossicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicles)\", a tiny bone\nembedded in your middle ear.  Like the ossicles in your ear, the\n``ocicl-runtime`` is a tiny library that is embedded in your lisp\nimage.  It is responsible for finding and loading\n[ASDF](https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/) systems that you manage with the\n``ocicl`` command line tool.\n\nThe main innovation behind ``ocicl`` is the idea of applying the\necosystem of tooling and services from the world of application\ncontainer images to ordinary tarballs of Lisp code. In essence, OCI + CL = ``ocicl``.\n\n``ocicl`` is under active development.  The ``ocicl-runtime`` is known\nto work with the following Common Lisp implementations:\n- [abcl](https://abcl.org)\n- [ecl](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp)\n- [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/)\n- [Allegro Common Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/)\n\nHowever, the ``ocicl`` command-line tool currently must be built with\nSBCL on either Linux, Windows or MacOS.  Adapting to other systems and\nplatforms should not be difficult, and pull requests are welcome at\nhttps://github.com/ocicl/ocicl/pulls.  Feedback is also welcome at\nhttps://github.com/ocicl/ocicl/issues.\n\nQuick Start\n------------\n\nYou can install `ocicl` one of two ways: with\n[homebrew](https://brew.sh) or from source.\n\nFor [homebrew](https://brew.sh) on Linux, Windows WSL, or macOS,\ninstall and configure `ocicl` as follows:\n```\ngreen@fedora:~$ brew install ocicl\n==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/ocicl/manifests/2.3.4\n########################################################################################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Fetching ocicl\n==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/ocicl/blobs/sha256:fe9b2d51c012851588baef450ff39b453526a7fc2c5df38e9071fc253b136150\n########################################################################################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Pouring ocicl--2.3.4.x86_64_linux.bottle.tar.gz\n🍺  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/ocicl/2.3.4: 8 files, 36.4MB\n==> Running `brew cleanup ocicl`...\ngreen@fedora:~$ ocicl setup\n;; Add the following to your lisp startup file\n;; (~/.sbclrc, ~/.eclrc, ~/.abclrc or ~/.roswell/init.lisp):\n\n#-ocicl\n(when (probe-file #P\"/home/green/.local/share/ocicl/ocicl-runtime.lisp\")\n  (load #P\"/home/green/.local/share/ocicl/ocicl-runtime.lisp\"))\n(asdf:initialize-source-registry\n  (list :source-registry (list :directory (uiop:getcwd)) :inherit-configuration))\n```\n\nTo install from source, run ``sbcl --load setup.lisp`` in the source\ndirectory.  This will build and install the ``ocicl`` binary in\n``~/.local/bin`` on non-Windows systems, and\n``%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\ocicl\\`` on Windows.\n\nThe `setup.lisp` script will build an `ocicl` binary with 3072MB of\ndynamic memory space.  If you need a different amount, run it like so:\n```\nsbcl --eval \"(defconstant +dynamic-space-size+ 2048)\" --load setup.lisp\n```\n\n\nNow run ``ocicl setup``.  This is a mandatory step that installs the\n``ocicl-runtime`` library, and suggests configurations for your\n``${HOME}/.sbclrc`` file.\n\n```\n$ ocicl setup\n;; Add the following to your lisp startup file\n;; (~/.sbclrc, ~/.eclrc, ~/.abclrc or ~/.roswell/init.lisp):\n\n#-ocicl\n(when (probe-file #P\"/home/green/.local/share/ocicl/ocicl-runtime.lisp\")\n  (load #P\"/home/green/.local/share/ocicl/ocicl-runtime.lisp\"))\n(asdf:initialize-source-registry\n  (list :source-registry (list :directory (uiop:getcwd)) :inherit-configuration))\n```\n\nThe default behavior for the runtime is to invoke ``ocicl`` when ASDF\ntries to load a system that it can't find.\n\nIf you are running behind a proxy, be sure to set your ``https_proxy``\nenvironment variable appropriately.  For instance, the following could\nbe used for an authenticating proxy:\n```\n$ export https_proxy=https://username:password@myproxyhost:8080\n```\n\nNow try running this:\n```\n$ sbcl --eval \"(asdf:load-system :str)\"\n```\n\nLook at your current directory.  You should see a directory called\n``ocicl`` and a file called ``ocicl.csv``.  The ``ocicl``\ndirectory contains the code you just downloaded, and ``ocicl.csv``\ncontains a mapping of system names to OCI artifacts and ``.asd``\nfiles.\n\n```\nstr.test, ghcr.io/ocicl/str@sha256:0903b59c33d3026ac55a6f4b25a79094d08e3110758d8ae728bf4188db659313, cl-str-20230511-b1c8380/str.test.asd\nstr, ghcr.io/ocicl/str@sha256:0903b59c33d3026ac55a6f4b25a79094d08e3110758d8ae728bf4188db659313, cl-str-20230511-b1c8380/str.asd\ncl-ppcre, ghcr.io/ocicl/cl-ppcre@sha256:5274824d397fa197d5c7790344ace27f2a30fc34c6cadb0a9fcce7d1e4052486, cl-ppcre-20230511-b4056c5a/cl-ppcre.asd\ncl-ppcre-unicode, ghcr.io/ocicl/cl-ppcre@sha256:5274824d397fa197d5c7790344ace27f2a30fc34c6cadb0a9fcce7d1e4052486, cl-ppcre-20230511-b4056c5a/cl-ppcre-unicode.asd\ncl-unicode, ghcr.io/ocicl/cl-unicode@sha256:b61ac07aed06c926720e6a4c155fd0c9411b01a05ee7ebba55fca7df491880e5, cl-unicode-20230511-2790a6b/cl-unicode.asd\nflexi-streams, ghcr.io/ocicl/flexi-streams@sha256:091df0cda6006b19aa206b022bb6d06fd9d5e5787b6152b9f0ae6846926ac5e0, flexi-streams-20230511-74a1027/flexi-streams.asd\nflexi-streams-test, ghcr.io/ocicl/flexi-streams@sha256:091df0cda6006b19aa206b022bb6d06fd9d5e5787b6152b9f0ae6846926ac5e0, flexi-streams-20230511-74a1027/flexi-streams-test.asd\ntrivial-gray-streams, ghcr.io/ocicl/trivial-gray-streams@sha256:e82a60fdccc33916f26b60a3af63ee110f0b364cc2af59eee4be86256e8ea2b6, trivial-gray-streams-20230511-2b3823e/trivial-gray-streams.asd\ntrivial-gray-streams-test, ghcr.io/ocicl/trivial-gray-streams@sha256:e82a60fdccc33916f26b60a3af63ee110f0b364cc2af59eee4be86256e8ea2b6, trivial-gray-streams-20230511-2b3823e/trivial-gray-streams-test.asd\ncl-change-case, ghcr.io/ocicl/cl-change-case@sha256:61791ee49f0160adad694eedbe8804fe9bcebad54336b0fbb8ce1a82091e20fa, cl-change-case-0.2.0/cl-change-case.asd\n```\n\nThe next time you try to load ``str``, ASDF will load the code that\nyou've already downloaded and compiled.\n\nNow try deleting the ``ocicl`` directory, and loading ``str`` again\nas above.  ``ocicl`` will download the exact version specified in the\n``ocicl.csv`` file.

Many lisp libraries are built from git sources\nwithout release tags.  In this case, the version label represents the\nbuild date and the git commit hash (b3af9c0).\n\nTo install any specific version of a system, just use the appropriate\nversion label in your ``ocicl install`` command.  For example:\n``ocicl install trivial-garbage:20230511-b3af9c0`` or\n``ocicl install str:latest``.\n\nRunning ``ocicl install SYSTEM`` with no version will do nothing\nif any version of ``SYSTEM`` is already installed (unless\n``--force`` is specified).  However, if a system version is specified\n(including ``latest``) then ``ocicl install`` will always download and\ninstall the system, even if it already exists on disk.\n\nTo compare differences between system versions, run `ocicl diff SYSTEM VERSION1\nVERSION2`.\n\nTo update all systems in your ``ocicl.csv`` file to the latest\nversion, run ``ocicl latest``.\n\nTo remove an installed system, use ``ocicl remove``.  By default,\n``ocicl`` will refuse to remove systems that are required to satisfy any\ndependencies.  Use the ``ocicl --force remove`` option to ignore any\ndependencies and always uninstall.\n\nTo use an alternate OCI registry for any operation, use the\n``--registry`` option.  Using ``--registry`` with the ``setup``\ncommand will persist this registry choice for all future ``ocicl``\ninvocations.  Subsequent uses of ``setup`` will preserve existing\nregistry choices unless the ``--force`` option used.\n\nWhile the `ocicl` cli tool only supports setting a single alternate\nregistry, it's possible to use multiple registries by adding multiple\nentries to the `ocicl-registry.cfg` file in your `${XDG_DATA_DIR}/ocicl`\ndirectory.\n\nIn the examples so far, we see that all system downloads are recorded\nin the current working directory.  This is the default behaviour.\nHowever, when `ocicl.csv` appears in any parent directory, all\nsystems are downloaded and recorded in the `ocicl` sub-directory of\nthat parent.  The ocicl runtime mirrors this behaviour when it comes\nto loading systems.  See the following for example usage.\n\n```\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking$ touch ocicl.csv\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking$ mkdir project-1\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking$ mkdir project-2\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking$ cd project-1\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking/project-1$ ocicl install str\n; downloaded str@sha256:3771c466d33a923d4fd1b1aa71f7a60d0029405e7fb3bafae1a3f19b7ac9b121\n; downloaded cl-ppcre@sha256:584907e0683621973579f397115945ef73e9d5b7afa77fae7cacecb3ad272f89\n; downloaded cl-unicode@sha256:d98f12c1271fb3c1812a27d64dfbe95b0bc5bcfd545b71b8101874e61270b120\n; downloaded cl-change-case@sha256:63b6a033f762d6dc5d365ce49f2a2c691677f2ec1375ebe4226d13b19a29dc7c\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking/project-1$ cd ../project-2/\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking/project-2$ ocicl install str\n; str:1bcf26d already exists\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking/project-2$ ls -l ../ocicl\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 green green 112 Oct 17 23:05 cl-change-case-0.2.1\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 green green 642 Oct 17 23:05 cl-ppcre-20240503-80fb19d\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 green green 216 Oct 17 23:05 cl-str-20240708-1bcf26d\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 green green 344 Oct 17 23:05 cl-unicode-20240503-07e7ff5\n```\n\nYou may also choose to download systems \"globally\" for the current\nuser by using the ``--global`` option.  This is equivalent to\ntemporarily changing directory to a user-global directory before\nperforming any operation with the `ocicl` cli.  These \"global\" systems\nare available at runtime using the following heuristic:\n- If the system is available locally, then it is loaded from from the local `ocicl` directory.\n- Else if the system is available in the global `ocicl` directory, it loaded from there.\n- Otherwise, if `ocicl-runtime:*download*` is non-nil, then the system is downloaded either locally or globally:\n    - if `ocicl-runtime:*force-global*` is non-nil, then the system is downloaded to the global `ocicl` directory.\n    - else if `ocicl-runtime:*force-global*` is nil (default), then the system is downloaded locally.\n\nTo change the default user-global directory, provide the\noptional ``GLOBALDIR`` argument when you invoke ``ocicl setup``.\n\nYou can change the default behaviour of downloading systems on demand\nby setting ``ocicl-runtime:*download*`` to nil.\n\nTo get a list of all of the systems already downloaded (both locally\nand globally), call `(ocicl-runtime:system-list)`.\n\nAI-Generated Change Summaries\n-----------------------------\n\nThe `ocicl` tool can provide summaries of changes between versions of\nLisp systems.  These summaries are produced by an LLM, and are\ndesigned to describe key changes and user impacts for newer versions\nof systems you depend on.\n\n* `ocicl changes`: describes every change for every newer version of systems `ocicl` has installed\n* `ocicl -v changes`: same, but provides verbose reporting on progress\n* `ocicl changes cl-chat`: describes changes for every newer version of `cl-chat`\n* `ocicl changes omg:20240427-5b316a0`: describes changes for every version of `omg` newer than `20240427-5b316a0`.\n\nThese summaries are pre-generated by the `ocicl` maintenance system by\nfeeding source code diffs to an LLM and uploading the results to the\nOCI registry.\n\nIn some cases the description may be missing as they only started\nbeing generated as of May 2024.\n\nDependency Freshness\n--------------------\n\n`ocicl` can compute the [libyear](https://libyear.com) dependency\nfreshness metric for the projects on which you depend.  It is a single\nnumber telling you how up-to-date your dependencies are.  The libyear\nvalue for a single project indicates the time between your version and\nthe most recent version.\n\n```\n$ ocicl libyear\nOMGlib              0.02 libyears (6.01 days)\ncl-opengl           0.02 libyears (7.01 days)\nlqn                 0.01 libyears (1.00 days)\nopenapi-generator   0.01 libyears (1.00 days)\ntrivial-arguments   0.01 libyears (3.01 days)\ngraven-image        0.01 libyears (2.01 days)\ncl-oju              0.02 libyears (4.01 days)\npy4cl2-cffi         0.02 libyears (6.01 days)\n\nTOTAL libyears: 0.09 (30.06 days)\n```\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nAll system tarballs have their sha256sum digest digitally signed with\nthe ocicl-tarball-signer key:\nB96ACDBF35C5C1AB81596FB6D3AFE1884397BDC8.\n\nYou can download the unexpanded tarballs using [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) or [oras](https://oras.land/) like so:\n```\n$ oras pull ghcr.io/ocicl/str:latest\nDownloading 577fc7118b8a cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz\nDownloaded  577fc7118b8a cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz\nPulled [registry] ghcr.io/ocicl/str:latest\nDigest: sha256:0903b59c33d3026ac55a6f4b25a79094d08e3110758d8ae728bf4188db659313\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 32\n-rw-r--r--. 1 green green 24609 May 19 09:02 cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz\n```\n\nSimilarly, the signature is available by appending ``.sha256sum.sig`` to the system name.\n```\n$ oras pull ghcr.io/ocicl/str.sha256sum.sig:latest\nDownloading 2a97da913ef7 cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz.sha256sum.sig\nDownloaded  2a97da913ef7 cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz.sha256sum.sig\nPulled [registry] ghcr.io/ocicl/str.sig:latest\nDigest: sha256:47903679d96504c5e83f08f7d6dfc4e613e7ab968e44dc46cb13b29f7917ddea\n```\n\nYou can verify the signature like so:\n```\n$ sha256sum cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz | gpg --verify cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz.sha256sum.sig -\ngpg: Signature made Thu 11 May 2023 05:44:45 AM EDT\ngpg:                using RSA key B96ACDBF35C5C1AB81596FB6D3AFE1884397BDC8\ngpg: Good signature from \"ocicl-tarball-signer\" [ultimate]\n```\n\nThese signatures are also archived in the\n[sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev) [rekor transparency\nlog](https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/).

at\n[https://docs.sigstore.dev/](https://docs.sigstore.dev/).\n\nSelf-Hosting\n------------\n\nYou may wish to self-host the ``ocicl`` registry.  This is easy, given\nthat the registry is just a regular OCI-compatible artifact registry.\nYou can use tools like\n[``skopeo``](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to copy artifacts\nfrom the default registry, ``ghcr.io/ocicl``, into your own.  Or you\nmay choose to run a local registry that does pull-through caching,\nlike the [Zot registry](https://zotregistry.dev).\n\nThe ``ocicl`` source distribution includes a [sample shell\nscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocicl/ocicl/main/mirror-example.sh)\nfor mirroring systems from ``ghcr.io/ocicl`` into a locally-hosted OCI\nregistry.\n\nBe sure to run ``setup`` with the ``--registry`` option to make this\nnew registry your default.\n\nSystems\n-------\n\nSystems managed by ``ocicl`` are maintained in github, at\n[https://github.com/ocicl](https://github.com/ocicl).  Each system has\nits own source repo, with a ``README.org`` file containing everything\nrequired to build and publish to the OCI registry via github actions.\n\nThe list of ocicl systems is always available at\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocicl/request-system-additions-here/main/all-ocicl-systems.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocicl/request-system-additions-here/main/all-ocicl-systems.txt).\n\nContributions are welcome and appreciated!  See\nhttps://github.com/ocicl/request-system-additions-here for details.\n\nTips and Troubleshooting\n------------------------\n\n* In the unlikely event that ``ghcr.io`` is unreachable, all packages\nare also available at ``docker.io/ocicl``.  Switch registries by\nrunning ``ocicl setup -r docker.io/ocicl``.\n\n* You may find it convenient to tell ASDF to load from the current directory.\nDo this by placing the following in your ``.sbclrc`` file:\n```\n(asdf:initialize-source-registry\n  (list :source-registry (list :directory (uiop:getcwd)) :inherit-configuration))\n```\n* As an ``ocicl`` user, you may have had experience using quicklisp's\n``local-projects`` mechanism, and are wondering how to do something\nsimilar.  ASDF itself provides a simple mechanism for searching a\ncollection of subdirs for ``.asd`` files.  If, for instance, you had\na directory in which you cloned various lisp systems called\n``/path/to/my/local-projects``, you would configure ASDF thusly:\n```\n(asdf:initialize-source-registry '(:source-registry :inherit-configuration (:tree #P\"/path/to/my/local-projects/\")))\n```\n* Setting ``ocicl-runtime:*verbose*`` to a stream (like ``t``, ``*standard-output*``, ``*error-output*``, etc) will output useful and\ninteresting log info.\n\n* ``ocicl`` is bundled with ``asdf`` version 3.3.7.  You can delete it\n(along with any fasl files) from the directory containing\n``ocicl-runtime.lisp`` if you do not want this version to be loaded by\nthe runtime at startup.\n\n* In addition to `ocicl.csv` with the `ocicl` systems directory, `ocicl`\n  additionally supports `systems.csv` and `systems` for backward compatibility\n  with earlier versions of ocicl.\n\nAuthor and License\n-------------------\n\n``ocicl`` was written by [Anthony Green](https://github.com/atgreen),\nand is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\nThis software includes Lisp source code files written by Zachary\nBeane, Mark Karpov, Ava Fox, and PMSF IT Consulting Pierre R. Mai.\nSee the ``ocicl`` source files for details.\n"},"annotations":{"audience":["assistant"]}},{"type":"text","text":"### /home/skin/Code/third/ocicl/README.md\n```markdown\n# ocicl\n> A modern ASDF system distribution and management tool for Common Lisp\n\nNOTE: To request additions to the ``ocicl`` repo, create an Issue\n[here](https://github.com/ocicl/request-system-additions-here/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=request.yml&title=%5BSystem+Request%5D%3A+).\n\nWhat is it?\n------------\n``ocicl`` is a modern alternative to quicklisp.  It is modern in the sense that:\n* All software is [packaged as OCI-compliant artifacts](https://github.com/opencontainers/) and distributed from mirrored OCI-compliant registries (the GitHub and Docker Hub Container Registries).\n* All software packages are securely distributed over TLS connections.\n* All connections respect ``HTTPS_PROXY`` environment settings for authenticated proxy support.\n* [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) is used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of all software packages.\n* Software packages are project-local by default, simplifying the process of tying specific versions to your projects.\n* All software packages are built and published transparently using hosted CI infrastructure ([github actions](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl-action)).\n* LLM-generated summaries of changes between versions are available for all packages.\n\n``ocicl`` is pronounced like\n\"[ossicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicles)\", a tiny bone\nembedded in your middle ear.  Like the ossicles in your ear, the\n``ocicl-runtime`` is a tiny library that is embedded in your lisp\nimage.  It is responsible for finding and loading\n[ASDF](https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/) systems that you manage with the\n``ocicl`` command line tool.\n\nThe main innovation behind ``ocicl`` is the idea of applying the\necosystem of tooling and services from the world of application\ncontainer images to ordinary tarballs of Lisp code. In essence, OCI + CL = ``ocicl``.\n\n``ocicl`` is under active development.  The ``ocicl-runtime`` is known\nto work with the following Common Lisp implementations:\n- [abcl](https://abcl.org)\n- [ecl](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp)\n- [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/)\n- [Allegro Common Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/)\n\nHowever, the ``ocicl`` command-line tool currently must be built with\nSBCL on either Linux, Windows or MacOS.  Adapting to other systems and\nplatforms should not be difficult, and pull requests are welcome at\nhttps://github.com/ocicl/ocicl/pulls.  Feedback is also welcome at\nhttps://github.com/ocicl/ocicl/issues.\n\nQuick Start\n------------\n\nYou can install `ocicl` one of two ways: with\n[homebrew](https://brew.sh) or from source.\n\nFor [homebrew](https://brew.sh) on Linux, Windows WSL, or macOS,\ninstall and configure `ocicl` as follows:\n```\ngreen@fedora:~$ brew install ocicl\n==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/ocicl/manifests/2.3.4\n########################################################################################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Fetching ocicl\n==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/ocicl/blobs/sha256:fe9b2d51c012851588baef450ff39b453526a7fc2c5df38e9071fc253b136150\n########################################################################################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Pouring ocicl--2.3.4.x86_64_linux.bottle.tar.gz\n🍺  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/ocicl/2.3.4: 8 files, 36.4MB\n==> Running `brew cleanup ocicl`...\ngreen@fedora:~$ ocicl setup\n;; Add the following to your lisp startup file\n;; (~/.sbclrc, ~/.eclrc, ~/.abclrc or ~/.roswell/init.lisp):\n\n#-ocicl\n(when (probe-file #P\"/home/green/.local/share/ocicl/ocicl-runtime.lisp\")\n  (load #P\"/home/green/.local/share/ocicl/ocicl-runtime.lisp\"))\n(asdf:initialize-source-registry\n  (list :source-registry (list :directory (uiop:getcwd)) :inherit-configuration))\n```\n\nTo install from source, run ``sbcl --load setup.lisp`` in the source\ndirectory.  This will build and install the ``ocicl`` binary in\n``~/.local/bin`` on non-Windows systems, and\n``%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\ocicl\\`` on Windows.\n\nThe `setup.lisp` script will build an `ocicl` binary with 3072MB of\ndynamic memory space.  If you need a different amount, run it like so:\n```\nsbcl --eval \"(defconstant +dynamic-space-size+ 2048)\" --load setup.lisp\n```\n\n\nNow run ``ocicl setup``.  This is a mandatory step that installs the\n``ocicl-runtime`` library, and suggests configurations for your\n``${HOME}/.sbclrc`` file.\n\n```\n$ ocicl setup\n;; Add the following to your lisp startup file\n;; (~/.sbclrc, ~/.eclrc, ~/.abclrc or ~/.roswell/init.lisp):\n\n#-ocicl\n(when (probe-file #P\"/home/green/.local/share/ocicl/ocicl-runtime.lisp\")\n  (load #P\"/home/green/.local/share/ocicl/ocicl-runtime.lisp\"))\n(asdf:initialize-source-registry\n  (list :source-registry (list :directory (uiop:getcwd)) :inherit-configuration))\n```\n\nThe default behavior for the runtime is to invoke ``ocicl`` when ASDF\ntries to load a system that it can't find.\n\nIf you are running behind a proxy, be sure to set your ``https_proxy``\nenvironment variable appropriately.  For instance, the following could\nbe used for an authenticating proxy:\n```\n$ export https_proxy=https://username:password@myproxyhost:8080\n```\n\nNow try running this:\n```\n$ sbcl --eval \"(asdf:load-system :str)\"\n```\n\nLook at your current directory.  You should see a directory called\n``ocicl`` and a file called ``ocicl.csv``.  The ``ocicl``\ndirectory contains the code you just downloaded, and ``ocicl.csv``\ncontains a mapping of system names to OCI artifacts and ``.asd``\nfiles.\n\n```\nstr.test, ghcr.io/ocicl/str@sha256:0903b59c33d3026ac55a6f4b25a79094d08e3110758d8ae728bf4188db659313, cl-str-20230511-b1c8380/str.test.asd\nstr, ghcr.io/ocicl/str@sha256:0903b59c33d3026ac55a6f4b25a79094d08e3110758d8ae728bf4188db659313, cl-str-20230511-b1c8380/str.asd\ncl-ppcre, ghcr.io/ocicl/cl-ppcre@sha256:5274824d397fa197d5c7790344ace27f2a30fc34c6cadb0a9fcce7d1e4052486, cl-ppcre-20230511-b4056c5a/cl-ppcre.asd\ncl-ppcre-unicode, ghcr.io/ocicl/cl-ppcre@sha256:5274824d397fa197d5c7790344ace27f2a30fc34c6cadb0a9fcce7d1e4052486, cl-ppcre-20230511-b4056c5a/cl-ppcre-unicode.asd\ncl-unicode, ghcr.io/ocicl/cl-unicode@sha256:b61ac07aed06c926720e6a4c155fd0c9411b01a05ee7ebba55fca7df491880e5, cl-unicode-20230511-2790a6b/cl-unicode.asd\nflexi-streams, ghcr.io/ocicl/flexi-streams@sha256:091df0cda6006b19aa206b022bb6d06fd9d5e5787b6152b9f0ae6846926ac5e0, flexi-streams-20230511-74a1027/flexi-streams.asd\nflexi-streams-test, ghcr.io/ocicl/flexi-streams@sha256:091df0cda6006b19aa206b022bb6d06fd9d5e5787b6152b9f0ae6846926ac5e0, flexi-streams-20230511-74a1027/flexi-streams-test.asd\ntrivial-gray-streams, ghcr.io/ocicl/trivial-gray-streams@sha256:e82a60fdccc33916f26b60a3af63ee110f0b364cc2af59eee4be86256e8ea2b6, trivial-gray-streams-20230511-2b3823e/trivial-gray-streams.asd\ntrivial-gray-streams-test, ghcr.io/ocicl/trivial-gray-streams@sha256:e82a60fdccc33916f26b60a3af63ee110f0b364cc2af59eee4be86256e8ea2b6, trivial-gray-streams-20230511-2b3823e/trivial-gray-streams-test.asd\ncl-change-case, ghcr.io/ocicl/cl-change-case@sha256:61791ee49f0160adad694eedbe8804fe9bcebad54336b0fbb8ce1a82091e20fa, cl-change-case-0.2.0/cl-change-case.asd\n```\n\nThe next time you try to load ``str``, ASDF will load the code that\nyou've already downloaded and compiled.\n\nNow try deleting the ``ocicl`` directory, and loading ``str`` again\nas above.  ``ocicl`` will download the exact version specified in the\n``ocicl.csv`` file.  The idea here is that you would commit your\n``ocicl.csv`` file to your project's source repo, but never the\n``ocicl`` directory.

Many lisp libraries are built from git sources\nwithout release tags.  In this case, the version label represents the\nbuild date and the git commit hash (b3af9c0).\n\nTo install any specific version of a system, just use the appropriate\nversion label in your ``ocicl install`` command.  For example:\n``ocicl install trivial-garbage:20230511-b3af9c0`` or\n``ocicl install str:latest``.\n\nRunning ``ocicl install SYSTEM`` with no version will do nothing\nif any version of ``SYSTEM`` is already installed (unless\n``--force`` is specified).  However, if a system version is specified\n(including ``latest``) then ``ocicl install`` will always download and\ninstall the system, even if it already exists on disk.\n\nTo compare differences between system versions, run `ocicl diff SYSTEM VERSION1\nVERSION2`.\n\nTo update all systems in your ``ocicl.csv`` file to the latest\nversion, run ``ocicl latest``.\n\nTo remove an installed system, use ``ocicl remove``.  By default,\n``ocicl`` will refuse to remove systems that are required to satisfy any\ndependencies.  Use the ``ocicl --force remove`` option to ignore any\ndependencies and always uninstall.\n\nTo use an alternate OCI registry for any operation, use the\n``--registry`` option.  Using ``--registry`` with the ``setup``\ncommand will persist this registry choice for all future ``ocicl``\ninvocations.  Subsequent uses of ``setup`` will preserve existing\nregistry choices unless the ``--force`` option used.\n\nWhile the `ocicl` cli tool only supports setting a single alternate\nregistry, it's possible to use multiple registries by adding multiple\nentries to the `ocicl-registry.cfg` file in your `${XDG_DATA_DIR}/ocicl`\ndirectory.\n\nIn the examples so far, we see that all system downloads are recorded\nin the current working directory.  This is the default behaviour.\nHowever, when `ocicl.csv` appears in any parent directory, all\nsystems are downloaded and recorded in the `ocicl` sub-directory of\nthat parent.  The ocicl runtime mirrors this behaviour when it comes\nto loading systems.  See the following for example usage.\n\n```\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking$ touch ocicl.csv\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking$ mkdir project-1\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking$ mkdir project-2\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking$ cd project-1\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking/project-1$ ocicl install str\n; downloaded str@sha256:3771c466d33a923d4fd1b1aa71f7a60d0029405e7fb3bafae1a3f19b7ac9b121\n; downloaded cl-ppcre@sha256:584907e0683621973579f397115945ef73e9d5b7afa77fae7cacecb3ad272f89\n; downloaded cl-unicode@sha256:d98f12c1271fb3c1812a27d64dfbe95b0bc5bcfd545b71b8101874e61270b120\n; downloaded cl-change-case@sha256:63b6a033f762d6dc5d365ce49f2a2c691677f2ec1375ebe4226d13b19a29dc7c\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking/project-1$ cd ../project-2/\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking/project-2$ ocicl install str\n; str:1bcf26d already exists\ngreen@fedora:~/hacking/project-2$ ls -l ../ocicl\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 green green 112 Oct 17 23:05 cl-change-case-0.2.1\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 green green 642 Oct 17 23:05 cl-ppcre-20240503-80fb19d\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 green green 216 Oct 17 23:05 cl-str-20240708-1bcf26d\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 green green 344 Oct 17 23:05 cl-unicode-20240503-07e7ff5\n```\n\nYou may also choose to download systems \"globally\" for the current\nuser by using the ``--global`` option.  This is equivalent to\ntemporarily changing directory to a user-global directory before\nperforming any operation with the `ocicl` cli.  These \"global\" systems\nare available at runtime using the following heuristic:\n- If the system is available locally, then it is loaded from from the local `ocicl` directory.\n- Else if the system is available in the global `ocicl` directory, it loaded from there.\n- Otherwise, if `ocicl-runtime:*download*` is non-nil, then the system is downloaded either locally or globally:\n    - if `ocicl-runtime:*force-global*` is non-nil, then the system is downloaded to the global `ocicl` directory.\n    - else if `ocicl-runtime:*force-global*` is nil (default), then the system is downloaded locally.\n\nTo change the default user-global directory, provide the\noptional ``GLOBALDIR`` argument when you invoke ``ocicl setup``.\n\nYou can change the default behaviour of downloading systems on demand\nby setting ``ocicl-runtime:*download*`` to nil.\n\nTo get a list of all of the systems already downloaded (both locally\nand globally), call `(ocicl-runtime:system-list)`.\n\nAI-Generated Change Summaries\n-----------------------------\n\nThe `ocicl` tool can provide summaries of changes between versions of\nLisp systems.  These summaries are produced by an LLM, and are\ndesigned to describe key changes and user impacts for newer versions\nof systems you depend on.\n\n* `ocicl changes`: describes every change for every newer version of systems `ocicl` has installed\n* `ocicl -v changes`: same, but provides verbose reporting on progress\n* `ocicl changes cl-chat`: describes changes for every newer version of `cl-chat`\n* `ocicl changes omg:20240427-5b316a0`: describes changes for every version of `omg` newer than `20240427-5b316a0`.\n\nThese summaries are pre-generated by the `ocicl` maintenance system by\nfeeding source code diffs to an LLM and uploading the results to the\nOCI registry.\n\nIn some cases the description may be missing as they only started\nbeing generated as of May 2024.\n\nDependency Freshness\n--------------------\n\n`ocicl` can compute the [libyear](https://libyear.com) dependency\nfreshness metric for the projects on which you depend.  It is a single\nnumber telling you how up-to-date your dependencies are.  The libyear\nvalue for a single project indicates the time between your version and\nthe most recent version.\n\n```\n$ ocicl libyear\nOMGlib              0.02 libyears (6.01 days)\ncl-opengl           0.02 libyears (7.01 days)\nlqn                 0.01 libyears (1.00 days)\nopenapi-generator   0.01 libyears (1.00 days)\ntrivial-arguments   0.01 libyears (3.01 days)\ngraven-image        0.01 libyears (2.01 days)\ncl-oju              0.02 libyears (4.01 days)\npy4cl2-cffi         0.02 libyears (6.01 days)\n\nTOTAL libyears: 0.09 (30.06 days)\n```\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nAll system tarballs have their sha256sum digest digitally signed with\nthe ocicl-tarball-signer key:\nB96ACDBF35C5C1AB81596FB6D3AFE1884397BDC8.\n\nYou can download the unexpanded tarballs using [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) or [oras](https://oras.land/) like so:\n```\n$ oras pull ghcr.io/ocicl/str:latest\nDownloading 577fc7118b8a cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz\nDownloaded  577fc7118b8a cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz\nPulled [registry] ghcr.io/ocicl/str:latest\nDigest: sha256:0903b59c33d3026ac55a6f4b25a79094d08e3110758d8ae728bf4188db659313\n\n$ ls -l\ntotal 32\n-rw-r--r--. 1 green green 24609 May 19 09:02 cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz\n```\n\nSimilarly, the signature is available by appending ``.sha256sum.sig`` to the system name.\n```\n$ oras pull ghcr.io/ocicl/str.sha256sum.sig:latest\nDownloading 2a97da913ef7 cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz.sha256sum.sig\nDownloaded  2a97da913ef7 cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz.sha256sum.sig\nPulled [registry] ghcr.io/ocicl/str.sig:latest\nDigest: sha256:47903679d96504c5e83f08f7d6dfc4e613e7ab968e44dc46cb13b29f7917ddea\n```\n\nYou can verify the signature like so:\n```\n$ sha256sum cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz | gpg --verify cl-str-20230511-b1c8380.tar.gz.sha256sum.sig -\ngpg: Signature made Thu 11 May 2023 05:44:45 AM EDT\ngpg:                using RSA key B96ACDBF35C5C1AB81596FB6D3AFE1884397BDC8\ngpg: Good signature from \"ocicl-tarball-signer\" [ultimate]\n```\n\nThese signatures are also archived in the\n[sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev) [rekor transparency\nlog](https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/).

at\n[https://docs.sigstore.dev/](https://docs.sigstore.dev/).\n\nSelf-Hosting\n------------\n\nYou may wish to self-host the ``ocicl`` registry.  This is easy, given\nthat the registry is just a regular OCI-compatible artifact registry.\nYou can use tools like\n[``skopeo``](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to copy artifacts\nfrom the default registry, ``ghcr.io/ocicl``, into your own.  Or you\nmay choose to run a local registry that does pull-through caching,\nlike the [Zot registry](https://zotregistry.dev).\n\nThe ``ocicl`` source distribution includes a [sample shell\nscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocicl/ocicl/main/mirror-example.sh)\nfor mirroring systems from ``ghcr.io/ocicl`` into a locally-hosted OCI\nregistry.\n\nBe sure to run ``setup`` with the ``--registry`` option to make this\nnew registry your default.\n\nSystems\n-------\n\nSystems managed by ``ocicl`` are maintained in github, at\n[https://github.com/ocicl](https://github.com/ocicl).  Each system has\nits own source repo, with a ``README.org`` file containing everything\nrequired to build and publish to the OCI registry via github actions.\n\nThe list of ocicl systems is always available at\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocicl/request-system-additions-here/main/all-ocicl-systems.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocicl/request-system-additions-here/main/all-ocicl-systems.txt).\n\nContributions are welcome and appreciated!  See\nhttps://github.com/ocicl/request-system-additions-here for details.\n\nTips and Troubleshooting\n------------------------\n\n* In the unlikely event that ``ghcr.io`` is unreachable, all packages\nare also available at ``docker.io/ocicl``.  Switch registries by\nrunning ``ocicl setup -r docker.io/ocicl``.\n\n* You may find it convenient to tell ASDF to load from the current directory.\nDo this by placing the following in your ``.sbclrc`` file:\n```\n(asdf:initialize-source-registry\n  (list :source-registry (list :directory (uiop:getcwd)) :inherit-configuration))\n```\n* As an ``ocicl`` user, you may have had experience using quicklisp's\n``local-projects`` mechanism, and are wondering how to do something\nsimilar.  ASDF itself provides a simple mechanism for searching a\ncollection of subdirs for ``.asd`` files.  If, for instance, you had\na directory in which you cloned various lisp systems called\n``/path/to/my/local-projects``, you would configure ASDF thusly:\n```\n(asdf:initialize-source-registry '(:source-registry :inherit-configuration (:tree #P\"/path/to/my/local-projects/\")))\n```\n* Setting ``ocicl-runtime:*verbose*`` to a stream (like ``t``, ``*standard-output*``, ``*error-output*``, etc) will output useful and\ninteresting log info.\n\n* ``ocicl`` is bundled with ``asdf`` version 3.3.7.  You can delete it\n(along with any fasl files) from the directory containing\n``ocicl-runtime.lisp`` if you do not want this version to be loaded by\nthe runtime at startup.\n\n* In addition to `ocicl.csv` with the `ocicl` systems directory, `ocicl`\n  additionally supports `systems.csv` and `systems` for backward compatibility\n  with earlier versions of ocicl.\n\nAuthor and License\n-------------------\n\n``ocicl`` was written by [Anthony Green](https://github.com/atgreen),\nand is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\nThis software includes Lisp source code files written by Zachary\nBeane, Mark Karpov, Ava Fox, and PMSF IT Consulting Pierre R. Mai.\nSee the ``ocicl`` source files for details.\n\n```\n","annotations":{"audience":["user"],"priority":0.0}}]}}]}

{"role":"assistant","created":1746299427,"content":[{"type":"text","text":"To write a parser for the SCSD format, we'll create a script that reads and interprets the SCSD markdown-like structure. Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the parser in Python, following the rules and structure outlined in the README.\n\n### Parser Structure\n\n1. **Read and Tokenize:** Start by reading the file line by line and categorizing the line type (e.g., database title, table title, description, table header, etc.).\n2. **Parse Components:**\n   - **Database Title and Description:** Starts with `# ` and includes lines until a new table begins.\n   - **Table Title and Description:** Starts with `## ` and includes lines until a header begins.\n   - **Table Header and Type Line:** Consists of lines starting with `|` and defines columns and their types.\n   - **Table Records:** Contains rows of data matching the header columns.\n3. **Validation:** Ensure correct line format and data consistency.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n\nclass SCSDParser:\n\n    def __init__(self, filepath):\n        self.filepath = filepath\n        self.data = {\n            'database_title': '',\n            'database_description': '',\n            'tables': {}\n        }\n        self.current_table = None\n\n    def parse(self):\n        with open(self.filepath, 'r') as file:\n            lines = file.readlines()\n\n        for line in lines:\n            if line.startswith('# '):\n                self.data['database_title'] = line[2:].strip()\n                self.data['database_description'] = ''\n            elif line.startswith('## '):\n                self.current_table = line[3:].strip()\n                self.data['tables'][self.current_table] = {\n                    'description': '',\n                    'columns': [],\n                    'types': [],\n                    'records': []\n                }\n            elif line.startswith('|'):\n                if not self.data['tables'][self.current_table]['columns']:\n                    # This is the table header\n                    self.data['tables'][self.current_table]['columns'] = [col.strip() for col in line.strip().split('|')[1:-1]]\n                elif not self.data['tables'][self.current_table]['types']:\n                    # This is the type line\n                    self.data['tables'][self.current_table]['types'] = [typ.strip() for typ in line.strip().split('|')[1:-1]]\n                else:\n                    # This is a table record\n                    self.data['tables'][self.current_table]['records'].append([val.strip() for val in line.strip().split('|')[1:-1]])\n            else:\n                if self.current_table:\n                    self.data['tables'][self.current_table]['description'] += line.strip() + ' '\n                else:\n                    self.data['database_description'] += line.strip() + ' '\n\n        return self.data\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    parser = SCSDParser('path/to/scsd/file.md')\n    parsed_data = parser.parse()\n    print(parsed_data)\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n- The parser reads the markdown file line by line.\n- It identifies the type of each line (database title, table header, etc.) based on specific markers (like `# ` or `|`).\n- It stores the parsed data into structured dictionaries, preserving the hierarchy of the database and tables.\n- You can modify the path to your SCSD file in the code to test it.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Validation:** Add more robust validation for data types and structure.\n- **Enhancements:** Incorporate advanced features like handling comments or special characters as described in the README.\n\nWould you like me to assist further with testing or validating the parser?"}]}
